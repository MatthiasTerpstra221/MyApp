# Enterprise Text Update Summary

The Enterprise text in the About HubSpot Hubs section has been updated in the static-build/index.html file in the parent directory.

The updated text highlights Leapforce's status as a HubSpot Elite Partner and positions Enterprise implementations as a service that's available rather than something that's not offered as a standard package.
